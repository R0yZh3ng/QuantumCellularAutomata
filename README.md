## What will the application do?

The application would be a **Quantum Cellular Automatat Simulator** designed to simulate/visualize quanutm interactions in a structured grid.
This simulator models quantum superpostion, entaglement, and measurement collapse over discrete timesteps ot help visualize quantum behaviour in 
cellular automaton like systems, qubit evolution, wave interference, and entanglement lines, explores quantum computing principles such as gate operations.

## Why this is of interest to me

Given recent events involving the drastic uprise and fall of quantum computing related concepts in the stock market (that I am unfortuantely losing money on), I have developed an interest for the actual technology involved. As we inevitably will transitiion to using quantum computers in the future, I am eager to understand how this technology works, as both a physics enthusiast and a possible candidate in the field.


## User Stories

A *bulleted* list:
- As a user, I want to be able to determine the size of the grid that the simulation will occur on/ adding x (qubits)  to y (grid).
- As a user, I want to be able to determine which interactions goes on so that I can test different interactions
- As a user, I want to be able to see the grid evolve following quantum gate rules in discrete time
- As a user, I want to be able to visualize the simulation with gradient color changes
